# CircuitBreakerMinigame_lua

This minigame originated from [TimothyDexter's](https://github.com/TimothyDexter) [repo](https://github.com/TimothyDexter/FiveM-CircuitBreakerMinigame), I converted it to lua and made it usable without any setup other than a resource to trigger it.

## Usage

You should read the code at the bottom of [circuit.lua](circuit.lua)
